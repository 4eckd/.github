### üîç Notable Security Findings

**Year In Review 2025: Critical Security Vulnerabilities**
- Discovered: Deceptive event emissions causing blockchain explorers to display misleading information (February 2025) 
- Disclosed: Hidden token redirection mechanisms in burn functions that secretly transfer tokens instead of destroying them (March 2025 | $SHFL) 
- Documented: Selective functionality patterns designed to obfuscate contract behavior (June 2025) 
- Disclosed: An Authentication bypass on a popular Metaverse platform which allowed any person to see private financial documents that should only have been seen by specific shareholders of those contracts (August 2025)
- Disclosed: A loss of funds to Stake.com based on Blockchain analysis (July 2025)
- Disclosed: Telegram Bot API does not destroy tokens when transfered or auctioned on fragment allowing the seller / attacker opportunity to unauthorized access to victims / reciever / buyer (March 2025)
- Disclosed: An online gambling platform that shared hidden user data through an insecure API endpoint even though users privacy settings were hidden (May 2025)
